> ### DynamicSurroundings-1.16.5-4.0.5.1
**Requirements**
* JAVA 8 w/Forge 1.16.5-36.2.26+
* 100% client side; no server side deployment needed
* Cloth Config API (Forge) is optional

**What's New**
* Update to 1.16.5-36.2.26+ baseline
  * This is the minimum Forge version needed to work with Java 8u321+

**Fixes**
* Removed all usages of `@OnlyIn` to help avoid potential issues in the future.
  * It's an internal annotation used by the Forge installer and dev environment. It has no effect in production, leading to issues where it might sometimes work as intended when testing in development but fail with the built jar in production. Therefore its usage is not recommended in order to avoid hard to reproduce issues like this.
* Gradle build using the default Java version and possibly causing incorrect builds depending on the version

> ### DynamicSurroundings-1.16.5-4.0.5.0
**Requirements**
* JAVA 8 w/Forge 1.16.5-36.2.0+
* 100% client side; no server side deployment needed
* Cloth Config API (Forge) is optional

**What's New**
* Update to 1.16.5-36.2.0+ baseline
  * Recommend Java 8.
  * Dynamic Surroundings uses JavaScript, and some mods include older script engines that are not compatible with Java versions newer than 8.  You can try using a newer version of Java, but if you see things related to Java security in the logs then downgrade back to 8.  In game this problem would show itself as biome sounds not playing.  (Enigmatica 6 is an example of this condition.)

**Notes**
* Started playing Enigmatica 6 recently.  I had to adjust the sea level override in the config to 57 because the Y value for sea level of the map is 57.

* Cloth Config API (Forge) is optional

**What's New**
* Option to configure the number of streaming sound channels.  Defaults to 10.  If a modpack has additional streaming sounds you may want to bump this value a little.
* [WIP] Twilight Forest support.  There are several known outstanding issues.  See issue tracker.

**Fixes**
* Crash in quick volume dialog due to conflicts between config auto save (Forge/TOML Library) and config file watcher (Forge)
* Crash due to malformed sounds.json files present in other mod folders.

**Changes**
* Auto-disable dimension sound for The End if Better End is installed.

* Sounds in the WATERFALL category will not be occluded by default.  Can be changed in the config.
* Add restart and range info to configuration tooltips
* More granular options to control footstep accenting.  Armor rustle sound option will be reset and have to be disabled if you prefer it disabled.
* Default sound culling interval is now 10 ticks (down from 20).  Maximum cull interval is 6000 ticks (5 minutes).
* Some translations for fr_fr from Mazdallier!  Thanks!

* Cloth Config API (Forge) is optional

**What's New**
* Added configuration menus.

  * If you forget you will get a dialog when you navigate to the config menu for Dynamic Surroundings.
  * Some modpacks already includes the Cloth API (Direwolf20 1.16 for example)
* Added option to disable footstep sounds (WIP).  If disabled:
  * Vanilla step sounds will be played as defined by the underlying block step sound type.
  * Armor/water splash sounds will still be played unless disabled.
  * Walking through items such as vines and reeds will still play effects.

**Fixes**
* Config had the wrong default setting for hiding player potion particles.  It should have been disabled.
* Sometimes persistent particle effects would not disappear when conditions changed.

**Changes**
* Sound stream conversion to mono if configured to do so.  Conversion will happen even if enhanced sound processing is disabled.  There is a config setting to independently enable/disable conversion.

Welcome to 1.16.4!  Unlike the 1.14.x and 1.15.x versions (Sound Control, Environs, and MobEffects) this JAR release combines all of them into a single JAR.  This is reflected in the Forge mod lists.

Here are some differences in this release vs. Dynamic Surroundings 1.12.2:

* Dynamic Surroundings 1.16.4 is licensed GPL-3 rather than MIT.  This does not affect your ability to add the mod to modpacks.
* Sound effects are built into Dynamic Surroundings:
  * The area around where a sound is played is scanned for reflective surfaces.  This will result in some amount of reverb being added.  This is apparent in large caves, or in houses with reflective surfaces.
  * Reflectivity of a block varies based on its material.  For example, a stone block is more reflective than wood planks, which in turn is more reflective than wool.  If you find your base having too much reverb add some sound padding/absorption material.
  * Sound occlusion is turned off by default (it needs some tuning).  Sound occlusion happens when a sound location is behind other blocks.  The more blocks the sound has to travel to the listener the more occluded the sound becomes.  Blocks like glass don't occlude much, whereas blocks like wool make for a good sound insulator.  Turn it on and try it out.
  * This complex sound processing occurs on a background worker thread, not on the rendering thread (main client side thread).  This means that impact of processing should be minimal.
  * Positioned sounds will be converted to mono on the fly if necessary.  For spacial sound processing to happen it needs to be in mono format. 
* There are no weather related features.  This is planned for the future.
* The Aurora is currently disabled in code.  I am having difficulty migrating the code to 1.16.4 and didn't want to hold up releasing.
* There are no in-game configuration menus.  Unlike prior versions Forge does not have this support.  I am looking for any libraries that provides this capability, so I can minimize the amount of GUI code I have to write.  (I dislike writing GUIs.)
* The Minecraft sound engine finally supports looping of streaming sounds.  This means that biome sounds that play in the background as well as continuous positioned sounds (waterfall) will not have stutters and the like.
* Dynamic Surroundings Nether background sound was removed.  Mojang did a pretty good job with the sound profile of the Nether and felt this was not needed.

The underlying configuration Jsons have changed.  There are several reasons for this:

* I am reworking how Dynamic Surroundings is configured, with the goal of making it flexible and easier to use.
* Be able to provide configs on disk that override any Jsons that are embedded in JARs or datapacks.
* Have more granular Json files rather than larger monolithic ones.
* Another mod could provide Dynamic Surroundings support for their work by adding addition information into their assets that Dynamic Surroundings can discover.

Here are some things you may encounter using this ALPHA:

* Minecraft 1.16.4 changed biomes, a lot.  I have noticed that some biome mods do not properly tag their biomes.  Dynamic Surroundings uses these tags to identify what sound features to give the biome.
* Particles could render strangely (water ripples, footsteps, etc.).  I think I have the proper rendering, but other mods may indirectly interfere.
* Json configs will load/process when you log in to a world.  This is to ensure that the client has the most up to date registries and datapacks from the server before applying its rules.  This may have some impact on login processing time.
